##About me
Hello! I am a 21 years old. I was born in Klimovichi. I graduated from the Belarusian State University in 2021 as a specialist in chemistry. Now I realized that I do not want to work as a chemist, so I decided to become a frontend developer. I have no experience in the IT field, i haven`t made any projects (hope i will!), but I have always been interested how computer works. If you need a code examples, you can use this page. At this moment I am studying at RS School. At present I am very motivated and ready to learn, thank God I quickly assimilate information.
